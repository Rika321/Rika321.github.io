I am still experimenting a good personal daily routine

## Morning routine:
I used to neglect the importance of the morning hours. To live a heathier life, I summarized a simplified and practical morning routine as followings:

  1. Dont scroll the phone until the routine ends
  2. Oral cleasing with floss/toothbrush
  3. (Optional) Cold shower
  4. Smoothie and breakfast preparation
  5. LLLR therapy and meditation for 4 minutes
  6. Take a walk outside (bonus point to practice basketball)
   

## Winddown routine:
I want to improve my sleep quality with the following routines:

  1. Supplements
  2. Oral cleasing with floss/toothbrush
  3. Journaling
  4. Don't scroll the phone on the bed
